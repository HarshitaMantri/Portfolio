# Portfolio
A personal portfolio is a great way to showcase your skills and experiences! Using CSS and HTML is a fantastic choice for building a visually appealing and interactive portfolio. Here's a basic outline to get you started:

HTML Structure:

1. Create an index.html file and add the basic HTML structure:
    - <head> (meta tags, title, links to CSS files)
    - <body> (content)
2. Divide your portfolio into sections using HTML elements like:
    - <header> (navigation, logo)
    - <section> (about, projects, skills, contact)
    - <footer> (copyright, social media links)

CSS Styling:

1. Create a styles.css file and link it to your HTML file.
2. Use CSS selectors to style your HTML elements:
    - Use classes and IDs to target specific elements.
    - Add visual styles like colors, fonts, padding, margins, and borders.
3. Use CSS layout properties like display, flex, and grid to arrange your content.
